;; making-rain-filtered

;Design a simple interactive animation of rain falling down a screen. Wherever we click,
;a rain drop should be created and as time goes by it should fall. Over time the drops
;will reach the bottom of the screen and "fall off". You should filter these excess
;drops out of the world state - otherwise your program is continuing to tick and
;and draw them long after they are invisible.
;
;In your design pay particular attention to the helper rules. In our solution we use
;these rules to split out helpers:
;  - function composition
;  - reference
;  - knowledge domain shift
;  
;  
;NOTE: This is a fairly long problem.  While you should be getting more comfortable with 
;world problems there is still a fair amount of work to do here. Our solution has 9
;functions including main. If you find it is taking you too long then jump ahead to the
;next homework problem and finish this later.
